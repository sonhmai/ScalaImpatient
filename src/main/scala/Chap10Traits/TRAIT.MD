Keys:
- a class can implement any number of traits
- traits can require implementing classes to have certain fields, methods, or superclasses
- unlike Java interfaces, scala trait can provide implementations of methods and fields
- when having multiple traits, order matters - trait whose methods execute first goes to the back
